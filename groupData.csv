Also, how to present the data in the right way which means what the audience want to know from the data? I think it is important to visualize information clearly and suitably for audiences. Moreover, I want to apply what I learned on web and mobile applications.",6,5,1,6,6,1,1,5,5,7,8,11,14,11,15,51,3,9,464
Horace Slughorn,Master in Science,Media Technology,"In my free time I often play multiplayer games with friends (or less frequently singelplayer games). Look at series and movies - both live action and animated. I did read a lot a few years ago, but can't really find the time nowadays. I'm also a music enthusiast and like the most genres. When I don't do anything of the above I look at streams à la Youtube or Twitch. ","I expect to learn neat ways of visualizing information and what to think about when doing it. 

Weird as I am, I sort my files and like to have a 'beautiful' structure in my computers hard drives, and when I stumble upon visualizations of large quantities of data on the internet I get really fascinated, I also like to keep track and visualize things in excel sheets. What I try to say is that I think this course is for me, and that is will be a lot of fun. The need for information visualization only increases the more data we produce, and as I'm interesed in the subject I most likely will use information visualization independent of where I'll work or what I'll work with.
